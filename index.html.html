 <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
<p>
Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam earned the title "Missile Man of India" for his pioneering role in India’s missile development program. 
He was the driving force behind the successful launch of ballistic missiles like Agni and Prithvi, which strengthened India’s defense capabilities. 
Working with DRDO and ISRO, he played a major role in making India a self-reliant nation in space and nuclear technology. 
His leadership in the 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests brought global attention to India’s scientific power. 
Despite working on powerful weapons, Kalam remained a man of peace who believed technology should serve humanity. 
His dedication, discipline, and deep patriotism inspired countless scientists and youth. 
He was not just a scientist, but a visionary who saw dreams for a stronger and safer India. 
People admired his humility as much as his brilliance. 
Even today, his contributions continue to inspire India’s scientific journey. 
Truly, Dr. Kalam is and will always be remembered as the "Missile Man of India."
